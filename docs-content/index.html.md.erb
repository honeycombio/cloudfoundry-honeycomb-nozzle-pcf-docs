This documentation describes the Honeycomb Nozzle for Pivotal Cloud Foundry
(PCF). The Honeycomb Nozzle listens to the Cloud Foundry logging Firehose,
parses all the messages it finds there, and sends them to the Honeycomb service,
https://honeycomb.io. In addition to the PCF-generated logs, application logs
that appear as JSON objects will be parsed and included, so you can explore your
application's performance using Honeycomb.
