Complete the following steps to create a UAA user that gives the Nozzle access to the Firehose and Cloud Controller.

1. Install the UAA CLI, uaac.

    ```
    $ gem install cf-uaac
    ```

2. Use the `uaac target uaa.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` command to target your UAA server:

    ```
    $ uaac target uaa.sys.example.com
    ```

3. Record the `uaa:admin:client_secret` from either:
    * The cf deployment manifest 
    * The Ops Manager UI, click the Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile, go to credentials tab, UAA > Admin Client Credentials

4. Authenticate to UAA using the client_secret from the previous step

    ```
    $  uaac token client get admin -s ADMIN-CLIENT-SECRET
    ```

5. Create a Honeycomb Nozzle user with the password of your choosing:

    ```
    $ uaac -t user add honeycomb-nozzle-user --password PASSWORD --emails na
    ```

6. Add the user to the Cloud Controller Admin Read-Only group:

    ```
    $ uaac -t member add cloud_controller.admin_read_only honeycomb-nozzle-user
    ```

7. Add the user to the Doppler Firehose group:

    ```
    $ uaac -t member add doppler.firehose honeycomb-nozzle-user
    ```

For information about creating a UAA user, see [Creating and Managing Users with the UAA CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/uaa-user-management.html).
